# add methods here...

# BST: Add
# Create an add(val) method on the BST object to add new value to the tree. 
# This entails creating a BTNode with this value and connecting it at the appropriate place in the tree. Unless specified otherwise, BSTs can contain duplicate values.



# BST: Contains
# Create a contains(val) method on BST that returns whether the tree contains a given value. 
# Take advantage of the BST structure to make this a much more rapid operation than SList.contains() would be.



# BST: Min
# Create a min() method on the BST class that returns the smallest value found in the BST.



# BST: Max
# Create a max() BST method that returns the largest value contained in the binary search tree.



# BONUS: BST: Size 
# Write a size() method that returns the number of nodes (values) contained in the tree.



# BONUS: BST: Is Empty
# Create an isEmpty() method to return whether the BST is empty (whether it contains no values).
